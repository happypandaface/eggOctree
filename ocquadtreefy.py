                     bug fixes and quadtree support by fenrirwolf


This is a replacement of raytaller's wonderful Egg Octree script.

Many people had problem using it (I always guessed wrong about the size of
cells) and it generated many "empty" branches which this one does not.  This one
also uses geoms/primitives instead of egg data for real time usage

original see : ( http://panda3d.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=2502 )
treeform's rewrite: ( http://www.panda3d.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?p=23267#23267 )
mindstormss's mod: ( http://www.panda3d.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?p=41362#41362 )
fenrirwolf's mod: ( http://www.panda3d.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?p=44007#44007 )

This script like the original also released under the WTFPL license.

Fenrir: I have also modified the script to support quad trees, plus fixed a bug
with calculating polywrap centers.  I removed combine(), because I felt it was
redundant.

Usage:
    newnode = octreefy (node, type='colpoly', maxDensity=64, verbose=0)
    newnode = quadtreefy (...)   [same parameters as above]

The input node is the node to be turned into an octree.  This can either be a
GeomNode or a PandaNode with a GeomNode child.  Will create a quad/octree for
this node.  Note that we do not expect multiple GeomNodes -- Flatten your
heirarchy first before you hand it over.  (If you want the old combiner method
back, just copy the combine function over from Mindstormss's script.)

The quad/octree is returned as a new node.  This node does not contain the
original node's states, so you will need to assign as appropriate.

Set verbose to 1 if you want to see a breakdown of what is returned.  Set it to
2 if you would also like to see tight bounds plus a random color for each leaf.

The type parameter controls what kind of geometry is returned.  If it set to
'geom', then a GeomNode with Primitives will be returned.  If it set to
'colpoly', then CollisionPolygons are returned.  You want to use CollisionPolys
if you intend to use this quad/octree for collisions, as it is much faster than
using GeomNodes.
